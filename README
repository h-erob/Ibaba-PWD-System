* `pwdCares_MockData.sql` – SQL script for mock data (optional)

---

## 🗓️ Database Setup

The system requires **MySQL** to be installed and running.
The database is **automatically created and initialized** when you run the JAR file.

### Configuration
**Database Credentials:**
* The system uses a configuration file `db_config.properties` to connect to MySQL.
* If your MySQL credentials differ from the defaults (`root/1234`), edit `db_config.properties`:

  db.username=your_mysql_username
  db.password=your_mysql_password

* The default database name is `members_system`, and it connects to `localhost:3306`.
  Modify `db.url_without_db` or `db.name` if needed.

**Mock Data:**
* If `load_mock_data=true` in `db_config.properties` and the database is empty, sample data from `pwdCares_MockData.sql` will be loaded.
* Set `load_mock_data=false` to skip this.

## ⚙️ Running the Application

### Prerequisites
* Java 8 or higher installed (**Java 24 recommended**)
* MySQL Server installed and running

### Steps
**1. Download the Files:**
* Obtain `MembershipSystem.jar`, `db_config.properties`, and `pwdCares_MockData.sql` (optional for mock data).

**2. Place Files:**
* Put all files in the same directory.

**3. Configure Database (Optional):**
* If your MySQL username or password isn’t `root/1234`, edit `db_config.properties` with your credentials.

**4. Run the JAR:**
* Double-click `MembershipSystem.jar` to launch.
* Or use the command line:
  java -jar MembershipSystem.jar

---

## 🔓 Login
Use the default admin account:
* **Username:** `admin`
* **Password:** `1234`

---

## 📌 Usage Notes
* The application creates the database and tables automatically on first run.
* Mock data loads only if the database is empty and `load_mock_data=true`.
* If errors occur (e.g., wrong MySQL credentials), a dialog box will display the issue.
